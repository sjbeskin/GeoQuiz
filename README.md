GEOQUIZ is a simple app that presents the user with true/false questions and allows them to answer. 
The function of my addition to the app is that the user is now able to add their own questions. 
By clicking the 'Add Question' button, users will be presented with a screen that allows them to create and add their own questions to the list.
Additionally, the user will be able to delete questions from the list, giving them the opportunity to make a fully customizable set of true/false questions.
